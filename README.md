# Google Analytics 4 Tutorial Series

This repository contains the code used in the demo website for the
Google Analytics 4 (GA4) Tutorial Series on YouTube. You can find
the code for each video in the [/tutorials](/tutorials) directory.

The current code is found in the [/src](/src) directory, which
contains all the changes made in each video up to the most recent
video.
